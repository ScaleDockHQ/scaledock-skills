description: Make a ScaleDock product enterprise-ready with SCIM 2.0 provisioning, OpenID Connect SSO, Shared Signals (SSF, CAEP, RISC) session revocation, FAPI 2.0 when needed, and SPIFFE workload identity, with PermDock turning directory groups and roles into permissions. Use when a customer asks for SSO, SCIM, automatic deprovisioning, continuous access evaluation, IdP-driven logout, Okta or Entra integration, high-security API profiles, or service-to-service identity.

# ScaleDock enterprise identity

Enterprise customers expect their identity provider to sign users in, provision and deprovision them, and revoke access the moment something changes. This skill wires those standards into a ScaleDock product and lets PermDock turn what the IdP says into permissions. The spec skills carry the rules of each standard.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Only add the parts the customer needs; each step names the input that switches it on.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- SSO: yes or no, and the customer's IdP (Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace, Keycloak, other).
- Provisioning: SCIM yes or no.
- Revocation: Shared Signals (CAEP) yes or no; Back-Channel Logout yes or no.
- Security profile: FAPI 2.0 yes or no (regulated finance, open banking, high-value APIs).
- Workloads: SPIFFE yes or no (service-to-service calls across trust domains).
- Tenancy: the scope a directory maps onto (usually the organization).

## Skills to install

```bash
npx skills add ScaleDockHQ/scaledock-skills --skill openid-connect --skill scim --skill shared-signals
npx skills add ScaleDockHQ/scaledock-skills --skill fapi --skill spiffe   # only when selected
npx skills add ScaleDockHQ/PermDock
```

`openid` (the umbrella over every OpenID Foundation spec) helps when the customer names a profile this skill does not cover, such as iGov or HEART. `scaledock-repo-standard` (`references/auth.md`, `references/data-permissions.md`) owns Supabase Auth, tenancy and RLS.

## Invariants

1. **The spec skills win on protocol details.** ID token validation follows `openid-connect`; provisioning endpoints follow `scim`; event tokens follow `shared-signals`; profile rules follow `fapi`; SVID checks follow `spiffe`.
2. **The IdP authenticates; PermDock authorizes.** Directory groups and role claims become memberships and roles, and PermDock decides from those. No handler branches on a raw group name.
3. **SCIM writes, it never decides.** The SCIM endpoint stores users and groups per tenant; PermDock reads them through a membership source and drops role names that are not assignable.
4. **Deprovisioning is immediate.** A SCIM deactivation, a CAEP `session-revoked` or a Back-Channel Logout invalidates snapshots, closes open streams and cancels pending approvals for that principal.
5. **Tenants are isolated.** Every SCIM token, SSO connection and SSF stream belongs to one tenant, and nothing from one tenant's IdP can change another tenant's memberships.
6. **Workloads are not users.** A verified SPIFFE ID or CI token becomes a workload principal, never a user, and gets only the permissions granted to that workload.

## Workflow

1. **Set the inputs.** Agree with the user which of SSO, SCIM, revocation, FAPI and SPIFFE apply per tenant.
   ✓ Every selected part names its IdP and tenant mapping.
2. **SSO.** Connect the IdP through Supabase Auth (SAML or OIDC) or, for a custom resource server, validate tokens as `openid-connect` and `jwt` describe and resolve the subject with `subjectFromJwt` from `permdock/jwt`.
   -> [`references/stack.md`](references/stack.md)
   ✓ A user from the IdP signs in to the right tenant, and a token from another issuer is rejected.
3. **Provisioning.** Mount `scimHandler` from `permdock/scim` per tenant, following `scim` for endpoints, filtering and PATCH, and pass `directoryMembershipSource(store)` as `memberships`.
   ✓ Creating, updating and deactivating a user in the IdP changes what that user can do on the next request.
4. **Revocation.** Mount the `permdock/ssf` receiver (push or poll) as `shared-signals` describes, and handle Back-Channel Logout as a second input. Pass `revocations` and `approvals` so streams close and approvals cancel.
   ✓ A `session-revoked` event ends that session's access without waiting for a cache to expire.
5. **Profiles and workloads.** With FAPI, apply `fapi` and use the PermDock JWT `profile: 'fapi2'` option and `permdock openapi emit --profile fapi2`. With SPIFFE, verify SVIDs as `spiffe` describes and map them to workload principals.
   ✓ The selected profile's checks pass.
6. **Test and audit.** Add scenario tests for join, role change, deactivation and revocation with `permdock/testing`, then run `audit-permissions` from `ScaleDockHQ/PermDock`.
   ✓ Tests pass and the audit has no blocker.

## Verify before done

- [ ] Every selected spec skill's Verify list passes.
- [ ] No handler reads a raw IdP group name; roles come from PermDock memberships.
- [ ] Deactivation and `session-revoked` take effect on the next request and close open streams.
- [ ] SCIM tokens, SSO connections and SSF streams are scoped to one tenant each.
- [ ] `permdock doctor` reports no error, and `pnpm verify` passes.
