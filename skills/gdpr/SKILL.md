# GDPR

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.

The publisher of the pinned text is named in [Sources](#sources). With this skill the agent applies that text when applying the General Data Protection Regulation.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources). Quoted requirements are sentences taken from the pinned text. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: a controller or a processor.
- Target version: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (current) — default. See [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md).
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) and check the publisher for a newer revision or version line.

## Invariants

1. **Article 16.** "it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality."
2. **Article 21.** "A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted."
3. **Article 58.** "When consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the supervisory authority with: (a) where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the processing, in particular for processing within a group of undertakings;"

## Workflow

1. **Pick the version.** Use the current line unless a named consumer needs a supported one. Do not author a legacy line. Emit a preview only when its posture is build and the user asked for that draft.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The target version is recorded, and it is not a legacy line.
2. **Apply the pinned requirements.** Walk the quotes in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md) and implement each one that applies to the role.
   -> [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md)
   ✓ Each applicable quote is either implemented or recorded as out of scope for the role, with the heading it came from.
3. **Upgrade** (only when asked). Follow the upgrade section from the source line to the target.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The result cites the target line and no longer depends on a requirement that only the old line stated.

## Verify before done

- [ ] The artifact cites the target line's revision from [Sources](#sources).
- [ ] Every applicable quoted requirement in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md) holds.
- [ ] Nothing from a preview line is emitted unless its posture is build and the user opted in.

## Reference index

- **`references/versions.md`**: every version line, which one to use, and how to upgrade. Load for steps 1 and 3.
- **`references/requirements.md`**: quotes taken from the pinned specification. Load for step 2.
