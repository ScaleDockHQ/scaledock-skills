# Standard Schema

Standard Schema is a family of TypeScript interfaces, designed by the creators of Zod, Valibot and ArkType, that let tools accept user-defined schemas from any compliant library without per-library adapters. The types are published as `@standard-schema/spec`. With this skill the agent consumes or implements `StandardSchemaV1` (validation) and `StandardJSONSchemaV1` (JSON Schema conversion), both built on `StandardTypedV1`.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources). The spec has no numbered sections, so citations name the interface member in `@standard-schema/spec` 1.1.0 (for example `StandardSchemaV1.SuccessResult`) or the FAQ question on the spec page. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: consumer (a tool that accepts schemas), implementer (a schema library), or both.
- Interfaces: `StandardSchemaV1` (validate), `StandardJSONSchemaV1` (convert to JSON Schema), or both.
- Sync or async: whether the consumer can await validation.
- Revision: the pinned package version in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill or when a rule looks out of date, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) first, check the npm registry for a newer `@standard-schema/spec` version and the repository tags for a new release, and update the pins.

## Invariants

1. **One namespaced property.** The whole interface lives under the `~standard` property, with `version: 1` and a `vendor` string naming the library (`StandardTypedV1.Props`; design goals "Avoid API conflicts").
2. **`validate` takes `unknown`.** `~standard.validate(value, options?)` returns a `Result` or a `Promise` of one (`StandardSchemaV1.Props.validate`). `options.libraryOptions` carries vendor-specific parameters (`StandardSchemaV1.Options`).
3. **The result shape decides success.** Success is `{ value }` with `issues` undefined; a falsy `issues` means success. Failure is `{ issues }`, an array of `Issue` (`StandardSchemaV1.SuccessResult`, `StandardSchemaV1.FailureResult`).
4. **Issues have a message and an optional path.** `message` is a string; `path` is an array whose segments are a `PropertyKey` or an object `{ key }` (`StandardSchemaV1.Issue`, `StandardSchemaV1.PathSegment`).
5. **Async is allowed but discouraged.** A consumer that only accepts synchronous validation throws when `validate` returns a `Promise`; libraries are encouraged to validate synchronously whenever possible (FAQ "How to only allow synchronous validation?").
6. **Types are type-level only.** `types` is optional and exists for inference; read it with `InferInput` and `InferOutput` (`StandardTypedV1.Types`, `StandardTypedV1.InferInput`, `StandardTypedV1.InferOutput`).
7. **The package is optional and types-only.** Copy the types or depend on `@standard-schema/spec` and import with `import type`. If the interface is part of your public API, it is a regular dependency, never a dev dependency (FAQ "Do I need to add `@standard-schema/spec` as a dependency?", "Can I add it as a dev dependency?").
8. **JSON Schema conversion may throw.** `~standard.jsonSchema.input(options)` and `.output(options)` return a JSON Schema object for a `target`; implementers should throw for unsupported targets, and consumers should account for a throw (`StandardJSONSchemaV1.Converter`, `StandardJSONSchemaV1.Options`; Standard JSON Schema FAQ "What about error handling?").
9. **The two specs are orthogonal.** `StandardJSONSchemaV1` has no validation; an object may implement either or both (Standard JSON Schema FAQ "What's the relationship between this and Standard Schema?").

## Workflow

1. **Add the types.** Depend on `@standard-schema/spec` at the pinned version as a regular dependency, or copy the interfaces verbatim.
   -> [`references/interface.md`](references/interface.md)
   ✓ The types match the pinned `src/index.ts`, and nothing imports them as values.
2. **Consume schemas.** Accept a generic `T extends StandardSchemaV1`, call `~standard.validate`, handle a `Promise` (await it or reject it), branch on `issues`, and normalize issue paths.
   -> [`references/consuming.md`](references/consuming.md)
   ✓ Input and output types come from `InferInput` and `InferOutput`, and no code depends on a specific `vendor`.
3. **Implement the interface** (schema library authors). Add `~standard` to every schema object, returning `{ value }` or `{ issues }` from your existing validation code.
   -> [`references/implementing.md`](references/implementing.md)
   ✓ The schema satisfies `StandardSchemaV1<Input, Output>` with `satisfies` or `implements`, and validates synchronously where possible.
4. **Generate JSON Schema** where needed. Call `jsonSchema.input` or `.output` with a `target`; implementers support `draft-2020-12` and `draft-07` at least.
   -> [`references/json-schema.md`](references/json-schema.md)
   ✓ Unsupported targets throw in the implementer and are caught in the consumer, and input and output schemas are chosen deliberately.
5. **Check which libraries qualify.** Confirm the minimum version of each validator your users bring.
   -> [`references/libraries.md`](references/libraries.md)
   ✓ Documentation names minimum versions from the spec pages, and notes libraries that need an adapter.

## Verify before done

- [ ] Each implemented schema satisfies the pinned interface: `version` is `1`, `vendor` is set, `validate` returns `{ value }` or `{ issues }`.
- [ ] Consumers test `result.issues` for truthiness, as the official `integrate.ts` example does, rather than testing `value`.
- [ ] A consumer that cannot await rejects a `Promise` result with a clear error, as in the spec FAQ.
- [ ] Issue paths are normalized from both segment forms before display or serialization.
- [ ] `@standard-schema/spec` is in `dependencies` (or the types are copied), never only in `devDependencies`, when it appears in your public types.
- [ ] JSON Schema calls pass an explicit `target` and handle a thrown error.
- [ ] Code compiles against the official examples in the repository's `packages/examples` at the pinned tag.
