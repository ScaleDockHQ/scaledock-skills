# Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack. ¶ This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial improvements, new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with the interchange format of RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format. ¶

The publisher of the pinned text is named in [Sources](#sources). With this skill the agent applies that text: when encoding CBOR or writing CDDL.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources). Quoted requirements are sentences taken from the pinned text. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: producer or consumer of this specification.
- Target version: RFC 8949 Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (default); RFC 8610 Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL): A Notational Convention to Express Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and JSON Data Structures (default); RFC 9165 Additional Control Operators for the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) (default). See [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md).
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) and check the publisher index for a newer revision or version line.

## Invariants

1. **abstract.** "The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack. ¶ This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial improvements, new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with the interchange format of RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format. ¶"

## Workflow

1. **Pick the version.** Use the current line unless a named consumer needs a supported one. Do not author a legacy line. Emit a preview only when its posture is build and the user asked for that draft.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The target version is recorded, and it is not a legacy line.
2. **Apply the pinned requirements.** Walk the quotes in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md) and implement each one that applies to the role.
   -> [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md)
   ✓ Each applicable quote is either implemented or recorded as out of scope for the role, with the heading it came from.
3. **Upgrade** (only when asked). Follow the upgrade section from the source line to the target.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The result cites the target line and no longer depends on a requirement that only the old line stated.

## Verify before done

- [ ] The artifact cites the target line's revision from [Sources](#sources).
- [ ] Every applicable quoted requirement in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md) holds.
- [ ] Nothing from a preview line is emitted unless its posture is build and the user opted in.

## Reference index

- **`references/versions.md`**: every version line, which one to use, and how to upgrade. Load for steps 1 and 3.
- **`references/requirements.md`**: quotes taken from the pinned specification. Load for step 2.
