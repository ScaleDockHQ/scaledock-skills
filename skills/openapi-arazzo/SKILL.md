# Arazzo Specification

The Arazzo Specification, published by the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI), describes sequences of API calls and their dependencies as workflows over one or more source descriptions (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI or other Arazzo documents). With this skill the agent writes, reviews, validates and executes Arazzo Descriptions.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources), with the section it cites. Section numbers are those of Arazzo 1.1.0. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: author (writes the description), executor (a tool, test runner or agent that runs workflows), or reviewer.
- Source descriptions: the OpenAPI and AsyncAPI documents the workflows call, and their `operationId`s.
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill or when a rule looks out of date, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) first, check [spec.openapis.org/arazzo](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/) for a newer version or schema iteration, check the `v1.2-dev` branch for movement, and update the pins.

## Invariants

1. **`arazzo`, `info`, `sourceDescriptions` and `workflows` are REQUIRED**, and both lists have at least one entry (§ 5.8.1.1). Tooling MUST interpret the document by `arazzo` (§ 5.8.1.1).
2. **`workflowId` is unique in the description and `stepId` is unique in its workflow**; both are case-sensitive and SHOULD match `[A-Za-z0-9_\-]+` (§ 5.8.4.1, § 5.8.5.1).
3. **A step targets exactly one of `operationId`, `operationPath`, `channelPath` or `workflowId`** (§ 5.8.5.1). With more than one non-`arazzo` source description, `operationId` MUST be written as `$sourceDescriptions.<name>.<operationId>` (§ 5.8.5.1).
4. **Prefer `operationId` over `operationPath` or `channelPath`** when the target operation has one (§ 5.8.5.1).
5. **Every `successCriteria` entry MUST pass** for the step to succeed, and the list is non-empty when present (§ 5.8.5.1, § 5.8.11.4.6).
6. **Defaults: success goes to the next step, failure ends the workflow** (§ 5.8.5.1). The first matching action in order is executed (§ 5.8.5.1).
7. **Operation step parameters set `in`**; with a `workflowId` step, parameters map to the target workflow's inputs (§ 5.8.6.1).
8. **Steps run in an order that satisfies `dependsOn` and every `$steps.<id>.outputs` reference** (§ 5.8.5.2.4). In a sequential workflow, a reference to a later step's outputs is an error (§ 5.8.5.2.5).
9. **Workflows from other Arazzo documents are listed in `sourceDescriptions`** (§ 5.3) and referenced by `$self` when the target has one (§ 5.5.2).
10. **Processing a description can perform unsafe operations on arbitrary hosts**; the consumer must make sure they are not harmful (§ 6).

## Workflow

1. **List the source descriptions.** Give each a `name`, `url` and `type` (`openapi`, `asyncapi` or `arazzo`). API URLs come from the source description's servers, not from the Arazzo document (§ 5.7).
   -> [`references/objects.md`](references/objects.md)
   ✓ Every operation the workflows call resolves in one of the listed sources.
2. **Define each workflow's contract.** Write `inputs` as JSON Schema 2020-12 and name the `outputs` the caller gets back.
   -> [`references/objects.md`](references/objects.md)
   ✓ Every `$inputs.*` used in steps is declared in `inputs`.
3. **Write the steps.** Point each at one operation or workflow, pass parameters and a request body with runtime expressions, and expose the values later steps need as `outputs`.
   -> [`references/expressions.md`](references/expressions.md), [`references/examples.md`](references/examples.md)
   ✓ Invariants 2, 3, 7 and 8 hold.
4. **Say what success means.** Add `successCriteria` to every step that can return more than one outcome, and to every AsyncAPI receive step.
   -> [`references/expressions.md`](references/expressions.md), [`references/asyncapi-steps.md`](references/asyncapi-steps.md)
   ✓ Each criterion with a `type` also has a `context` (§ 5.8.11.5).
5. **Handle the other paths.** Add `onFailure` retries with `retryAfter` and `retryLimit` for transient errors, `goto` for branches, and workflow-level actions for shared handling. Factor repeats into `components`.
   -> [`references/execution.md`](references/execution.md)
   ✓ Every retry has a limit, and every `goto` target exists in the same workflow or is a resolvable `workflowId`.
6. **Validate.** Validate against the official Arazzo schema for the declared version, then check what the schema cannot.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ Schema validation passes, and every reference resolves.
7. **Execute safely** (executor role). Run steps in dependency order, evaluate criteria as specified, and treat the description as untrusted input.
   -> [`references/execution.md`](references/execution.md)
   ✓ No step runs against a host or operation the operator has not approved.

## Verify before done

- [ ] The description validates against the Arazzo 1.1 schema, iteration 2026-04-15 ([`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)).
- [ ] Every `operationId`, `operationPath`, `channelPath` and `workflowId` resolves in a listed source description (§ 5.8.5.1).
- [ ] Every runtime expression matches the ABNF in § 5.9, and every referenced step output exists on an earlier or `dependsOn` step (§ 5.8.5.2).
- [ ] Every component key matches `^[a-zA-Z0-9\.\-_]+$` (§ 5.8.9.1), and every Reusable Object `reference` points to an existing component (§ 5.8.10).
- [ ] Every AsyncAPI step sets `action`, and every receive step has `successCriteria` or meets both conditions for omitting it (§ 5.8.5.3).
- [ ] The entry document is named `arazzo.yaml` or `arazzo.json` (RECOMMENDED, § 5.3).
