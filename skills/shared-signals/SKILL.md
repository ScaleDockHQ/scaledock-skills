# Shared Signals

The OpenID Shared Signals Framework (SSF) lets a transmitter send signed security events to receivers over managed streams. CAEP defines session and access events; RISC defines account events. With this skill an agent builds or reviews a transmitter or receiver, its event payloads, and its delivery and validation logic.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources), with the section it cites. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: transmitter, receiver, or both.
- Delivery: push (`urn:ietf:rfc:8935`), poll (`urn:ietf:rfc:8936`), or both.
- Events: which CAEP, RISC or custom event types the stream carries.
- Profile: plain SSF 1.0, or the CAEP Interoperability Profile (pinned ID1, with the working-group draft tracked).
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill or when a rule looks out of date, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) first, check the Shared Signals WG specifications page for a newer revision, and update the pins.

## Invariants

These come from SSF 1.0 unless another document is named.

1. **Discovery is bound to the issuer** (SSF §7.2, §7.2.4). Metadata lives at `/.well-known/ssf-configuration`, inserted between host and path. Its `issuer` equals the issuer URL used for discovery and the `iss` of every SET.
2. **Each SET is a typed JWT with one event** (SSF §4.1.1, §4.2.1; RFC 8417 §2.3). The header `typ` is `secevent+jwt`. Each SET carries exactly one event in `events`.
3. **Subjects use `sub_id`, never `sub`** (SSF §3.1, §4.1.2; RFC 9493 §4.1). The top-level `sub_id` holds a subject identifier with a `format`. New event types MUST NOT use the `subject` event member (§3.1.2).
4. **No `exp` on SETs** (SSF §4.1.7). The `iss` matches the stream configuration (§4.1.6), and `aud` names the receiver (§4.1.8).
5. **Receivers validate before acting** (RFC 8935 §2, SSF §4.1, RFC 8417). They check the signature against the transmitter's `jwks_uri` keys, then `iss`, `aud`, `typ` and the event type, and they ignore unknown members (SSF §4.2.3).
6. **Delivery acknowledges correctly** (RFC 8935 §2.2, RFC 8936 §2). A push endpoint returns 202 with an empty body, or 400 with an `err` code. A poll receiver acknowledges every SET by `jti`.
7. **Streams are managed over authenticated HTTP** (SSF §8). Creating a stream returns 201, and the receiver checks the `iss` in the response. Deleting a stream returns 204.
8. **Status changes are announced** (SSF §8.1.5). Before pausing or disabling a stream, and when re-enabling it, the transmitter sends `stream-updated`. A paused stream holds events in order.
9. **Verification proves the path** (SSF §8.1.4). A verification event's `sub_id` is `opaque` with the `stream_id`. The receiver checks that `state` matches, and answers `invalid_state` if it does not.
10. **Subject handling is privacy-safe** (SSF §9.1, §9.3). An add-subject success does not mean the subject exists or that events will follow. Receivers tolerate events for subjects they removed.

## Workflow

1. **Pin role, delivery, events and profile.** Record the inputs.
   ✓ The event list and delivery method are named for each stream.
2. **Model SETs and subjects.** Build or parse the SET claims and subject identifiers.
   -> [`references/sets-and-subjects.md`](references/sets-and-subjects.md)
   ✓ Every SET has `typ` `secevent+jwt`, one event, a `sub_id`, and no `sub` or `exp`.
3. **Pick the event payloads.** Use the CAEP and RISC event types with their required claims.
   -> [`references/events.md`](references/events.md)
   ✓ Each event carries its required claims, using the spec's values.
4. **Implement the transmitter.** Metadata, stream configuration, status, subjects, verification and delivery.
   -> [`references/transmitter.md`](references/transmitter.md)
   ✓ The well-known document, stream CRUD, status and verify endpoints answer with the status codes in the reference.
5. **Implement the receiver.** Discovery, stream creation, SET validation and push or poll handling.
   -> [`references/receiver.md`](references/receiver.md)
   ✓ A SET with a bad signature, wrong `iss`, wrong `aud` or wrong `typ` is rejected with the RFC 8935 error code.
6. **Apply the CAEP Interoperability Profile if required.** It pins mandatory endpoints, scopes, formats, algorithms and use cases.
   -> [`references/caep-interop.md`](references/caep-interop.md)
   ✓ Every MUST in the profile for the chosen role holds.
7. **Connect Back-Channel Logout if relevant.** Validate logout tokens and map them to session revocation.
   -> [`references/backchannel-logout.md`](references/backchannel-logout.md)
   ✓ Logout tokens are validated per Back-Channel Logout §2.6 and end the matching sessions.

## Verify before done

- [ ] `GET /.well-known/ssf-configuration` returns metadata whose `issuer` equals the discovery URL issuer.
- [ ] Every SET header has `typ: secevent+jwt`; every payload has `iss`, `jti`, `iat`, `aud`, `sub_id` and exactly one event, and no `sub` or `exp`.
- [ ] The receiver rejects a SET signed with an unknown key, with a wrong `iss` or `aud`, or with an unknown critical subject member.
- [ ] Push returns 202 with no body on success, and 400 with `err` and `description` on failure.
- [ ] Poll acknowledges each processed `jti` and reports failures in `setErrs`.
- [ ] A verification request returns 204, and the resulting event echoes `state`.
- [ ] Pausing or disabling a stream emits `stream-updated` first.
- [ ] If the CAEP Interoperability Profile applies, the SSF conformance test plan for the role passes.
