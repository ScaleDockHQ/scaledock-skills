# AsyncAPI Specification

The AsyncAPI Specification, published by the AsyncAPI Initiative, describes message-driven APIs in a machine-readable, protocol-agnostic format. A document describes one application: the servers it connects to, the channels messages flow through, the operations the application performs, and the messages themselves. With this skill the agent writes, reviews, migrates and validates AsyncAPI 3.x documents.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources), with the object it cites. The AsyncAPI Specification has no numbered sections, so rules cite the object or section heading (for example "§ Operation Object"). When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: author (describes an application), consumer (generates code or docs from a document), or reviewer.
- The application: which side it is. Every operation describes what this application does (`send` or `receive`), not what others do.
- Protocols and brokers in use, which decide the bindings.
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill or when a rule looks out of date, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) first, check the AsyncAPI releases page and the spec-json-schemas releases for a newer version, and update the pins.

## Invariants

1. **`asyncapi` and `info` are REQUIRED** (§ AsyncAPI Object); `info` needs `title` and `version` (§ Info Object). Tooling ignores the patch version (§ AsyncAPI Version String).
2. **Everything outside `components` MUST be used by the application**; components may or may not be (§ File Structure).
3. **Root `operations` are operations the application MUST implement**, each with `action: send | receive` and a `channel` reference (§ Operations Object, § Operation Object).
4. **References between root objects stay at the root.** A root operation's `channel` points into root `channels`, and a root channel's `servers` point into root `servers`; both MUST be Reference Objects (§ Operation Object, § Channel Object).
5. **Every message on a channel MUST be valid against exactly one of the channel's messages** (§ Channel Object). An operation's `messages` MUST be a subset of its channel's messages (§ Operation Object).
6. **A channel `address` has no query or fragment**, and `parameters` appear only when the address has `{name}` expressions, one per expression (§ Channel Object, § Parameters Object).
7. **Message `headers` MUST NOT define protocol headers** (§ Message Object), and a binding MUST define only protocol-specific information (§ Definitions, Bindings).
8. **Security lists are alternatives**: one scheme in a server's or operation's `security` list suffices, and operation security adds to server security (§ Server Object, § Operation Object).
9. **Traits never override the target.** They merge with JSON Merge Patch in order, and a trait property MUST NOT override the same property on the object (§ Traits Merge Mechanism).
10. **Component keys match `^[a-zA-Z0-9\.\-_]+$`** (§ Components Object), and extensions match `^x-[\w\d\.\x2d_]+$` (§ Specification Extensions).

## Workflow

1. **Fix the point of view.** Name the application the document describes and give it an `id`, preferably a URN (§ Identifier).
   ✓ Every operation can be read as "this application sends" or "this application receives".
2. **Describe servers.** Give each `host`, `protocol`, optional `pathname`, `protocolVersion`, variables and `security`.
   -> [`references/objects.md`](references/objects.md), [`references/bindings-and-security.md`](references/bindings-and-security.md)
   ✓ No server has a `url` field; that was 2.x.
3. **Describe channels and messages.** Key each channel by an ID, put the topic or path in `address`, list its messages, and add parameters for address expressions.
   -> [`references/objects.md`](references/objects.md)
   ✓ Invariants 5 and 6 hold.
4. **Describe operations.** One operation per thing the application does, with `action`, a `channel` reference, optional `messages`, and `reply` for request-reply.
   -> [`references/objects.md`](references/objects.md), [`references/examples.md`](references/examples.md)
   ✓ Invariants 3 and 4 hold, and reply channels with a dynamic address use `address: null` plus a reply `address` location.
5. **Add bindings and security.** Put broker-specific settings in bindings at the server, channel, operation or message level, and declare security schemes under `components.securitySchemes`.
   -> [`references/bindings-and-security.md`](references/bindings-and-security.md)
   ✓ Every binding key is one of the defined protocols, and every security entry is a scheme or a reference to one.
6. **Migrate a 2.x document** (only when asked). Use the converter, then review the result against the list of breaking changes.
   -> [`references/migration-from-2.md`](references/migration-from-2.md)
   ✓ No `publish`, `subscribe`, `oneOf` message lists or `url` server fields remain.
7. **Validate.** Validate with the JSON Schema for the exact version declared, then check the rules the schema cannot express.
   -> [`references/validation.md`](references/validation.md)
   ✓ Schema validation passes, and the manual checks pass.

## Verify before done

- [ ] The document validates against the official JSON Schema for its exact `asyncapi` version, for example `3.1.0.json` from spec-json-schemas v6.11.1 ([`references/validation.md`](references/validation.md)).
- [ ] Every root operation's channel is a root channel, and every root channel's servers are root servers (§ Operation Object, § Channel Object).
- [ ] Every operation's `messages` is a subset of its channel's messages (§ Operation Object).
- [ ] Every address expression has a parameter, and every parameter has an expression (§ Parameters Object).
- [ ] Every message has a `contentType` or the document has `defaultContentType` (§ Message Object).
- [ ] Non-default payload formats use a Multi Format Schema Object with a `schemaFormat` from the formats table, and references inside it use the same format (§ Multi Format Schema Object).
- [ ] The file is named `asyncapi.yaml` or `asyncapi.json` by convention (§ File Structure).
