# CommonMark

<p>foo<a href="https://example.com/?search=%5D(uri)">https://example.com/?search=</a></p>

The publisher of the pinned text is named in [Sources](#sources). With this skill the agent applies that text: when parsing CommonMark.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources). Quoted requirements are sentences taken from the pinned text. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: producer or consumer of this specification.
- Target version: CommonMark 0.31.2 (default). See `references/versions.md`.
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) and check the publisher index for a newer revision or version line.

## Invariants

1. **CommonMark Spec.** "The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."
2. **CommonMark Spec.** "It is natural to think that they, too, must be indented four spaces, but Markdown.pl does not require that."
3. **CommonMark Spec.** "What should we do with a list like this?"
4. **CommonMark Spec.** "For example, how should the following be parsed?"
5. **CommonMark Spec.** "2.3 Insecure characters For security reasons, the Unicode character U+0000 must be replaced with the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER ( U+FFFD )."
6. **CommonMark Spec.** "The opening sequence of # characters must be followed by spaces or tabs, or by the end of line."
7. **CommonMark Spec.** "The optional closing sequence of # s must be preceded by spaces or tabs and may be followed by spaces or tabs only."
8. **CommonMark Spec.** "However, the space was required by the original ATX implementation , and it helps prevent things like the following from being parsed as headings: Example 64 Try It #5 bolt #hashtag <p>#5 bolt</p> <p>#hashtag</p> This is not a heading, because the first # is escaped: Example 65 Try It \## foo <p>## foo</p> Contents are parsed as inlines: Example 66 Try It # foo _bar_ \*baz\* <h1>foo <em>bar</em>…"

## Workflow

1. **Pick the version.** Use the current line unless a named consumer needs a supported one. Do not author a legacy line. Emit a preview only when its posture is build and the user asked for that draft.
   -> `references/versions.md`
   ✓ The target version is recorded, and it is not a legacy line.
2. **Apply the pinned requirements.** Walk the quotes in `references/requirements.md` and implement each one that applies to the role.
   -> `references/requirements.md`
   ✓ Each applicable quote is either implemented or recorded as out of scope for the role, with the heading it came from.
3. **Upgrade** (only when asked). Follow the upgrade section from the source line to the target.
   -> `references/versions.md`
   ✓ The result cites the target line and no longer depends on a requirement that only the old line stated.

## Verify before done

- [ ] The artifact cites the target line's revision from [Sources](#sources).
- [ ] Every applicable quoted requirement in `references/requirements.md` holds.
- [ ] Nothing from a preview line is emitted unless its posture is build and the user opted in.

## Reference index

- **`references/versions.md`**: every version line, which one to use, and how to upgrade. Load for steps 1 and 3.
- **`references/requirements.md`**: quotes taken from the pinned specification. Load for step 2.
