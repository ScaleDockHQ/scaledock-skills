# Web Bot Auth

Web Bot Auth is the IETF Web Bot Auth (webbotauth) working group's protocol for automated HTTP clients to sign their requests with RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures, and for websites to verify them. The signer names an HTTPS URL in a `Signature-Agent` header where its public keys are published; the verifier resolves that URL and checks the signature. With this skill the agent implements the signer role, the verifier role, or a key directory.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources), with the section it cites (§ numbers refer to `draft-ietf-webbotauth-httpsig-protocol-00` unless they say RFC 9421). When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

Draft posture: **build**, pinned to `draft-ietf-webbotauth-httpsig-protocol-00` (1 September 2026), the working group draft that replaced `draft-meunier-webbotauth-httpsig-protocol-02` and absorbed the separate directory draft. RFC 9421 underneath is stable.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: signer (Agent), verifier (Origin or a fronting proxy), directory operator, or several.
- Discovery type the signer publishes: `directory` (default, well-known URI on an origin), `jwks_uri` or `cimd` (§ 5.5).
- Algorithms: which RFC 9421 algorithms to sign with or accept, for example `ed25519` (RFC 9421 § 3.3, § 6.2.2).
- Target version: draft-ietf-webbotauth-00 (default, posture build: implement it). The draft-meunier individual drafts are legacy: read them and upgrade from them, never build new signers on them; verifiers may still accept the legacy bare-String `Signature-Agent` (§ 5.2.1). No preview exists. See [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md).
- Revision: the pinned draft in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill or when a rule looks out of date, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources), check the datatracker page of the working group draft for a newer revision or a replacement, check the webbotauth working group page for new documents, and update the pins.

## Invariants

1. **Signers cover `@authority` or `@target-uri`** and set `created`, `expires`, `keyid` and `tag="web-bot-auth"` (§ 5.2). `keyid` is the base64url JWK SHA-256 thumbprint of the key (§ 5.2). Expiry of no more than 24 hours is recommended (§ 5.2).
2. **Every signed request carries `Signature-Agent`** in dictionary form, with an `https` URI per signature label, and the signature covers its own member, for example `"signature-agent";key="sig1"` (§ 5.2.1, § 4.3).
3. **No shared secrets.** HMAC (`hmac-sha256`) must not be used; each client should use its own asymmetric key pair (§ 6.4).
4. **Verifiers follow RFC 9421 § 3.2** and fail verification on unknown or untrusted keys and on algorithms outside their allowed set (RFC 9421 § 3.2 steps 5 and 6).
5. **Key lookup is keyed on the (URL, key) pair**, never on `keyid` alone (§ 5.4).
6. **A `Signature-Agent` value is a claim until resolved.** Verifiers must not attach policy to it or attribute a request to it until they have fetched that URL, or hold proof per § 5.5.3, and found the key (§ 4.1, § 4.4).
7. **Discovery fetches must return 200 and must not follow redirects automatically** (§ 5.5). Directories are served over HTTPS; at the well-known URI with `application/http-message-signatures-directory+json` (§ 5.5.1).
8. **A failed fetch never evicts a cached directory**; a successful fetch that lacks the key does (§ 6.10).
9. **A valid signature identifies the signer, nothing more.** It does not authenticate a human user, and does not express authorization, delegation or consent (§ 4.1, § 4.6, § 5.2.2).

## Workflow

1. **Pick the version.** Use draft-ietf-webbotauth-00. If an existing signer or verifier cites a `draft-meunier-*` draft, sends a bare-String or `data:` `Signature-Agent`, or looks keys up by `keyid` alone, plan the upgrade (step 7).
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The target is recorded as `draft-ietf-webbotauth-httpsig-protocol-00`.
2. **Signer: generate and publish keys.** Create an asymmetric key pair per agent, publish the public key as a JWKS at the chosen discovery URL, and plan rotation.
   -> [`references/signer-and-directory.md`](references/signer-and-directory.md)
   ✓ The directory answers 200 over HTTPS with a JWKS whose `kid` values, if present, equal the thumbprints (§ 5.5), and with the directory media type at the well-known URI.
3. **Signer: sign each request.** Build the covered components and parameters, compute the RFC 9421 signature base, sign, and send `Signature`, `Signature-Input` and `Signature-Agent`.
   -> [`references/signer-and-directory.md`](references/signer-and-directory.md), [`references/http-message-signatures.md`](references/http-message-signatures.md)
   ✓ The request verifies against the published key with the RFC 9421 algorithm, and the signature is generated per request with bounded `created` and `expires` (§ 6.9).
4. **Verifier: parse and select signatures.** Parse the three fields, select signatures with `tag="web-bot-auth"`, and check covered components and freshness.
   -> [`references/verifier.md`](references/verifier.md)
   ✓ Malformed fields get 400 or are ignored by policy (§ 5.4); signatures without the tag can be discarded.
5. **Verifier: resolve keys.** Resolve the `Signature-Agent` member covered by the signature with bounded, cached, SSRF-safe fetches.
   -> [`references/verifier.md`](references/verifier.md)
   ✓ Fetches have size, key count, timeout and address limits (§ 6.7); cache respects HTTP caching (Appendix C.4).
6. **Verifier: decide.** Verify, classify as verified, invalid or unverified, and apply local policy.
   -> [`references/verifier.md`](references/verifier.md)
   ✓ Unverified requests stay in the existing bot-management path and never become trusted (Appendix C.1, C.9).
7. **Upgrade** (only when asked). Follow the checklist from the individual drafts: dictionary `Signature-Agent` on every request with `https` values, typed discovery, (URL, key) lookup, no redirects.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ Requests verify against the current draft's rules with the same keys and directory URL as before.

## Verify before done

- [ ] `Signature-Input` has `created`, `expires`, `keyid` and `tag="web-bot-auth"`, and covers `@authority` (or `@target-uri`) and the `signature-agent` member for its label.
- [ ] `keyid` equals the RFC 7638 thumbprint of the public key (RFC 8037 Appendix A.3 for Ed25519), computed, not chosen.
- [ ] `Signature-Agent` uses the dictionary form with an `https` URL; `directory` values are bare origins (§ 5.5).
- [ ] The verifier indexes keys by (URL, key) and attributes a request only to a URL it resolved.
- [ ] Discovery fetches reject non-200 responses, do not auto-follow redirects, and block private, loopback and link-local addresses.
- [ ] No HMAC keys, no test keys from RFC 9421 in production (§ 6.4, § 6.8), and no long-lived static signatures (§ 6.9).
- [ ] Requests over plain HTTP with `Signature` headers are refused or ignored (§ 6.1).
