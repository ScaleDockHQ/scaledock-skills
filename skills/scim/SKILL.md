# SCIM 2.0

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) 2.0 is an HTTP and JSON protocol for provisioning identities across domains. A SCIM client, usually the identity provider, creates, updates, deactivates and deletes Users and Groups at a SCIM service provider, usually the application. This skill pins RFC 7643 (schema), RFC 7644 (protocol), RFC 9865 (cursor pagination) and RFC 9967 (security events), and produces a server, client or review that meets their rules.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources), with the section it cites. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: SCIM service provider (server), SCIM client, or both. RFC 7643 §1.2 defines both roles; RFC 7642 §2.2.2 describes the actors behind them.
- Resources: Users only, or Users and Groups, plus any extensions such as the Enterprise User extension.
- Profile: plain RFC 7643 and RFC 7644, the IPSIE AL SCIM profile (AL1 or AL2), or the FastFed Enterprise SCIM profile.
- Optional features: PATCH, Bulk, filtering, sorting, ETags, cursor pagination, security events.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill or when a rule looks out of date, check the RFC Editor info page of each RFC for "Updated by" entries, re-read the IPSIE AL draft and FastFed specification pages, then every URL in [Sources](#sources). Update the pins and bump the version.

## Invariants

1. **TLS always.** Clients and service providers MUST require TLS; the service provider MUST support TLS 1.2; the client MUST check the server identity (RFC 7644 §7.2). Bearer tokens and cookies MUST be exchanged over TLS (RFC 7644 §7.4).
2. **Every request maps to an access policy.** The service provider MUST map the authenticated client to an access control policy before it retrieves or updates resources (RFC 7644 §2). Bearer tokens MUST have enough entropy and a limited lifetime (RFC 7644 §7.4).
3. **The service provider owns `id` and `meta`.** It assigns them on create; `id` is unique across the service provider, stable, never reassigned, and MUST NOT be set by the client; `meta` is ignored when a client sends it (RFC 7643 §3.1).
4. **The client owns `externalId`.** The service provider MUST NOT set it and MUST interpret it as scoped to the provisioning domain (RFC 7643 §3.1).
5. **Every resource and message declares `schemas`.** Resources carry their schema URIs (RFC 7643 §3); messages use the `urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:` URIs (RFC 7644 §3.1).
6. **Mutability decides what a write can change.** `readOnly` values are ignored on create and PUT; `immutable` values must match once set; PATCH MUST NOT modify `readOnly` or set `immutable` attributes (RFC 7644 §3.3, §3.5.1, §3.5.2).
7. **PUT never creates, and PATCH is atomic.** PUT MUST NOT be used to create resources (RFC 7644 §3.5.1). A PATCH is applied in order and atomically; if one operation fails the resource MUST be restored (RFC 7644 §3.5.2).
8. **Errors use the SCIM Error message.** Errors MUST be returned in the body as `urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error` with `status` as a string, plus `scimType` for 400s where defined (RFC 7644 §3.12).
9. **Conflicts are 409 `uniqueness`.** A create that duplicates a unique value such as `userName` MUST return 409 with `scimType` `uniqueness` (RFC 7644 §3.3).
10. **Deleted means gone.** After DELETE, the service provider MUST return 404 for the resource and omit it from queries (RFC 7644 §3.6).
11. **Unknown filters fail.** A service provider MUST reject an unrecognized filter operation with 400 `invalidFilter` (RFC 7644 §3.4.2.2), and MUST return 413 when a bulk request exceeds its limits (RFC 7644 §3.7.4).
12. **Passwords are write-only.** `password` is never returned in any form, and stored values MUST NOT be cleartext (RFC 7643 §4.1.1, §9.2).
13. **Sensitive filters do not go in URLs.** Clients SHOULD use POST `/.search` for filters with personal data, and servers SHOULD answer such GETs with 403 (RFC 7644 §7.5.2).

## Workflow

1. **Scope the work.** Confirm the role, resources, profile and optional features from Inputs.
   ✓ The design lists each endpoint and method to support, and which profile applies.
2. **Model the resources.** Define User, Group and extension attributes with their characteristics, and the common attributes.
   -> [`references/schema.md`](references/schema.md)
   ✓ Every attribute has type, mutability, returned, uniqueness and caseExact settled.
3. **Implement create, read, replace, patch and delete.** Apply the mutability rules, status codes, `Location` and `meta.location`.
   -> [`references/protocol.md`](references/protocol.md)
   ✓ POST returns 201 with `Location`; DELETE returns 204; a later GET returns 404.
4. **Implement queries.** Filters, sorting, `attributes` and `excludedAttributes`, index or cursor pagination, and POST `/.search`.
   -> [`references/protocol.md`](references/protocol.md), [`references/pagination.md`](references/pagination.md)
   ✓ An empty result is 200 with `totalResults` 0, and an unknown operator is 400 `invalidFilter`.
5. **Add Bulk, ETags and errors.** Bulk with `bulkId` and `failOnErrors`, ETags with `If-Match` and `If-None-Match`, and the error tables.
   -> [`references/protocol.md`](references/protocol.md)
   ✓ A stale `If-Match` gets 412, and an oversized bulk request gets 413.
6. **Publish discovery.** Serve `/ServiceProviderConfig`, `/ResourceTypes` and `/Schemas`, with the RFC 9865 `pagination` and RFC 9967 `securityEvents` attributes where used.
   -> [`references/discovery.md`](references/discovery.md)
   ✓ The ServiceProviderConfig flags match what the server actually supports.
7. **Secure it.** Authentication, authorization per client, tenancy, TLS, privacy and credential handling.
   -> [`references/security.md`](references/security.md)
   ✓ A token for one tenant cannot read or change another tenant's resources.
8. **Apply the profile.** For IPSIE AL or FastFed, add their authentication, filter and timing rules.
   -> [`references/profiles.md`](references/profiles.md)
   ✓ Each MUST in the chosen profile maps to a test.
9. **Add security events if used.** Emit or consume RFC 9967 SETs, and support asynchronous requests.
   -> [`references/events.md`](references/events.md)
   ✓ A 202 response carries `Set-Txn`, and the completion SET has the same `txn`.

## Verify before done

- [ ] All traffic is HTTPS, and requests without valid credentials get 401 (RFC 7644 §3.12).
- [ ] Responses use `Content-Type: application/scim+json` (RFC 7644 §8.1).
- [ ] POST `/Users` with a duplicate `userName` gets 409 with `"scimType": "uniqueness"`.
- [ ] PATCH with a failing second operation leaves the resource unchanged.
- [ ] `GET /Users?filter=userName eq "x"` works, and a bad filter gets 400 `invalidFilter`.
- [ ] `ListResponse` carries `totalResults`, and `startIndex` and `itemsPerPage` when paged.
- [ ] `/ServiceProviderConfig` reports `patch`, `bulk`, `filter`, `changePassword`, `sort`, `etag` and `authenticationSchemes`.
- [ ] Error bodies use the Error schema and `status` is a string.
- [ ] `password` is never returned, and no resource uses the string `bulkId` in an identifier (RFC 7643 §3.1).
