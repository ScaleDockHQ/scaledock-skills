# AI Preferences (aipref)

The IETF AI Preferences (aipref) working group defines a vocabulary for stating how content may be used by automated processing systems (`draft-ietf-aipref-vocab`), and how to attach those statements to content served over HTTP with a `Content-Usage` header field and a `Content-Usage` rule in robots.txt (`draft-ietf-aipref-attach`, which updates RFC 9309). With this skill the agent publishes preferences for a site, or parses, combines and applies them in a crawler or AI agent.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources), with the section it cites. "vocab §" refers to `draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-08` and "attach §" to `draft-ietf-aipref-attach-05`. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

Draft posture: **build** for both families. Neither draft is an RFC, and both mark large parts as without working group consensus (vocab "Note to Readers", § 3, § 4). Implement the pinned revisions exactly, and re-check the datatracker before relying on a label.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: publisher (origin, CDN or host that declares preferences), consumer (crawler, AI agent, training or search pipeline that reads them), or both.
- Attachment: the `Content-Usage` header field, the robots.txt `Content-Usage` rule, or both (attach § 1.2).
- Consumer identity: the robots.txt product token the crawler matches groups with (RFC 9309 § 2.2.1).
- Unknown policy (consumer): what the consumer does when a category comes out unknown. The drafts take no position (vocab § 5); record it as the consumer's own policy.
- Target version: two families, each with one current line.
  - Vocabulary: draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-08 (default, posture build: implement it). draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-05 to -07, draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-03 to -04, draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-02 and draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-00 to -01 are legacy: read and upgrade from them, never author them.
  - Attachment: draft-ietf-aipref-attach-05 (default, posture build). draft-ietf-aipref-attach-00 is legacy.
  - No preview exists. See [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md).
- Revision: the pinned revisions in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill or when a rule looks out of date, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources), check both datatracker pages for a newer revision, an RFC or a replacement, check the working group page for newly adopted documents, check the IANA field registry for `Content-Usage`, and update the pins.

## Invariants

1. **Three categories, three outcomes.** The vocabulary defines AI Training (`train-ai`), AI Use (`ai-use`) and Search (`search`) (vocab § 4, § 6.1). Each category resolves to allowed, disallowed or unknown; with no statement, everything is unknown (vocab § 3, § 5).
2. **The syntax is a Structured Fields Dictionary** of lowercase keys and the Tokens `y` (allow) or `n` (disallow) (vocab § 6, § 6.2; RFC 9651 § 3.2). Labels are case sensitive (vocab § 6.1).
3. **Anything else is unknown, not an error.** A missing key, a non-Token value (including a bare key, which is Boolean true) or a Token other than `y` or `n` gives unknown (vocab § 6.5). Unknown labels and unknown parameters MUST be ignored (vocab § 6.4). A Dictionary that fails to parse, for example one with an uppercase key, makes every preference unknown (vocab § 6.5.1).
4. **The last duplicate key wins** (vocab § 6.5.1; RFC 9651 § 4.2.2), and only its parameters apply (vocab § 6.5.2).
5. **Combine by most restrictive.** Across statements from different methods or parties, absent another resolution: any disallow gives disallow, else any allow gives allow, else unknown (vocab § 5.1). This also resolves robots.txt rules with identical paths and conflicting preferences (attach § 3.1).
6. **Search overrides the other categories** for a use that meets its conditions: links to the original location, excerpts only to judge relevance, no generated summaries (vocab § 4.3).
7. **`Content-Usage` describes the message content, not the resource.** It is representation metadata and has no special effect on caching (attach § 2).
8. **robots.txt preferences follow crawl permission.** `Content-Usage` rules use the Allow and Disallow longest-match, by bytes of the encoded path, within the group selected for the crawler; disallowed paths carry no preferences, and rule order carries no meaning (attach § 3, § 3.1; RFC 9309 § 2.2.1, § 2.2.2).
9. **Preferences come from the robots.txt current at fetch time** and do not apply retroactively; a cached robots.txt may hide updates for up to 24 hours (attach § 3.1, § 3.3; RFC 9309 § 2.4).
10. **Preferences are not enforcement.** They are not a security mechanism (vocab § 8), the drafts do not say whether or when to follow them (vocab § 3.2), contracts can override them (vocab § 5.2), and their source is unknown unless the method identifies it (vocab § 3.1).
11. **Parse as adversarial input,** following RFC 9651 § 6 and RFC 9110 § 17; robots.txt stays within the 500 KiB parsing limit (attach § 4; RFC 9309 § 2.5).

## Workflow

1. **Pick the versions.** Use draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-08 and draft-ietf-aipref-attach-05. If an existing statement uses labels such as `bots`, `all`, `tdm` or `train-genai`, plan the upgrade (step 8).
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ Both target revisions are recorded, and no legacy label is planned for output.
2. **Map the intent to categories** (publisher). Decide `y`, `n` or nothing for `train-ai`, `ai-use` and `search`, knowing what each excludes: non-generative training, user-provided input, summaries (vocab § 4.1 to § 4.3).
   -> [`references/vocabulary.md`](references/vocabulary.md)
   ✓ Every category the declaring party cares about has an explicit value; the rest are deliberately left unknown.
3. **Serialize the statement.** Write a Dictionary such as `train-ai=n, search=y`, with no uppercase, no bare keys and no duplicates (vocab § 6, § 6.5.1).
   -> [`references/vocabulary.md`](references/vocabulary.md)
   ✓ The string parses as an RFC 9651 Dictionary and yields the intended values.
4. **Attach it** (publisher). Send `Content-Usage` on responses, and/or add path-scoped `Content-Usage` rules to the right robots.txt groups (attach § 2, § 3).
   -> [`references/attachment.md`](references/attachment.md)
   ✓ For each sample URL and crawler token, the crawl decision and the preference match the plan (attach § 3.4 table method).
5. **Collect statements** (consumer). Select the robots.txt group for your product token, find the longest-matching `Content-Usage` rule for crawlable paths, and parse every `Content-Usage` header on the response (attach § 3.1, § 3.2; RFC 9651 § 4.2).
   -> [`references/processing.md`](references/processing.md)
   ✓ Each fetched asset has the statements found, with the robots.txt version used.
6. **Resolve and apply** (consumer). Turn each statement into per-category outcomes, combine them most-restrictively, apply the search override for qualifying uses, then apply the unknown policy (vocab § 4.3, § 5, § 5.1).
   -> [`references/processing.md`](references/processing.md)
   ✓ Each use of an asset maps to one category and one recorded outcome.
7. **Review limits and security.** Check parsing limits, untrusted input, caching delays, and that nothing presents preferences as access control (vocab § 8; attach § 4).
   -> [`references/processing.md`](references/processing.md)
   ✓ Access that must be blocked uses robots.txt Disallow or real access control, not `Content-Usage`.
8. **Upgrade** (only when asked). Follow the checklist for the source revision: rename or drop labels, rewrite group-level attach-00 rules as path-scoped rules, and re-check meaning.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The new statement parses under vocab-08, and every intent the old one expressed is either kept or listed as not expressible.

## Verify before done

- [ ] Every published value is a Dictionary of lowercase `train-ai`, `ai-use` or `search` keys with `y` or `n` Tokens (vocab § 6.1, § 6.2).
- [ ] No published statement uses a legacy label (`tdm`, `ai`, `genai`, `inference`, `all`, `bots`, `train-genai`, `ai-output`) (see versions).
- [ ] robots.txt `Content-Usage` paths start with `/`, percent-encode SP and HTAB, and sit in the group the target crawler selects (attach § 3.1, § 3.2; RFC 9309 § 2.2.1).
- [ ] The consumer treats parse failures, unknown labels and non-`y`/`n` values as unknown, never as allow (vocab § 6.4, § 6.5).
- [ ] Conflicts resolve most-restrictively, including header versus robots.txt (vocab § 5.1).
- [ ] The consumer's default for unknown is written down as its own policy (vocab § 5).
- [ ] Documentation calls preferences preferences, not access control or enforcement (vocab § 3.2, § 8).
