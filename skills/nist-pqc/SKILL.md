# NIST PQC

Laurie E. Locascio, NIST Director and Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology

The publisher of the pinned text is named in [Sources](#sources). With this skill the agent applies that text: when implementing NIST post-quantum cryptography.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources). Quoted requirements are sentences taken from the pinned text. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: producer or consumer of this specification.
- Target version: FIPS 203 (default); FIPS 204 (default); FIPS 205 (default); SP 800-227 (default). See [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md).
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) and check the publisher index for a newer revision or version line.

## Invariants

1. **document.** "Comments concerning this Federal Information Processing Standard publication are welcomed and should be submitted using the contact information in the “Inquiries and Comments” clause of the announcement section."
2. **document.** "Exports of cryptographic modules that implement this standard and technical data regarding them must comply with all federal laws and regulations and be licensed by the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S."
3. **document.** "The decapsulation key must be kept private and must be destroyed after it is no longer needed."
4. **document.** "The decryption key must be kept private and must be destroyed after it is no longer needed."
5. **document.** "A set of two keys with the property that one key can be made public while the other key must be kept private."
6. **document.** "The shared secret key must be kept private and must be destroyed when no longer needed."
7. **document.** "should Used to indicate a strong recommendation but not a requirement of this standard."
8. **document.** "The bytes must be freshly generated using randomness from an approved RBG."

## Workflow

1. **Pick the version.** Use the current line unless a named consumer needs a supported one. Do not author a legacy line. Emit a preview only when its posture is build and the user asked for that draft.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The target version is recorded, and it is not a legacy line.
2. **Apply the pinned requirements.** Walk the quotes in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md) and implement each one that applies to the role.
   -> [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md)
   ✓ Each applicable quote is either implemented or recorded as out of scope for the role, with the heading it came from.
3. **Upgrade** (only when asked). Follow the upgrade section from the source line to the target.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The result cites the target line and no longer depends on a requirement that only the old line stated.

## Verify before done

- [ ] The artifact cites the target line's revision from [Sources](#sources).
- [ ] Every applicable quoted requirement in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md) holds.
- [ ] Nothing from a preview line is emitted unless its posture is build and the user opted in.

## Reference index

- **`references/versions.md`**: every version line, which one to use, and how to upgrade. Load for steps 1 and 3.
- **`references/requirements.md`**: quotes taken from the pinned specification. Load for step 2.
