# Unicode Text Segmentation (UAX #29)

implementations can produce these divisions. However, it does provide conformance clauses to enable implementations to clearly describe their behavior in relation to the default behavior.

The publisher of the pinned text is named in [Sources](#sources). With this skill the agent applies that text: when splitting text into graphemes, words or sentences.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources). Quoted requirements are sentences taken from the pinned text. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: producer or consumer of this specification.
- Target version: UAX #29 (default). See [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md).
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) and check the publisher index for a newer revision or version line.

## Invariants

1. **Contents.** "The specification needs to allow the designation of large sets of characters sharing the same characteristics (for example, uppercase letters), while the implementation must provide quick access and matches to those large sets."
2. **Contents.** "The mechanism also must handle special features of the Unicode Standard, such as nonspacing marks and conjoining jamos."
3. **Contents.** "When this is done, the Common/Inherited values need to be handled properly, and the Script_Extensions property should be used instead of the Script property alone."
4. **Contents.** "This specification defines default mechanisms; more sophisticated implementations can and should tailor them for particular locales or environments and, for the purpose of claiming conformance, document the tailoring in the form of a profile."
5. **Contents.** "When limits on data size are desirable, they should be used together with word or character count limits."
6. **Contents.** "Word boundaries, line boundaries, and sentence boundaries should not occur within a grapheme cluster: in other words, a grapheme cluster should be an atomic unit with respect to the process of determining these other boundaries."
7. **Contents.** "For example, the text editing framework must know if a digraph is represented as a single glyph in the font, and therefore may not be able to position a cursor at the proper position separating its two components."
8. **Contents.** "That framework must also be able to determine display representation in cases where two glyphs overlap—this is true generally when a character is displayed together with a subsequent nonspacing mark, but must also be determined in detail for complex script rendering."

## Workflow

1. **Pick the version.** Use the current line unless a named consumer needs a supported one. Do not author a legacy line. Emit a preview only when its posture is build and the user asked for that draft.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The target version is recorded, and it is not a legacy line.
2. **Apply the pinned requirements.** Walk the quotes in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md) and implement each one that applies to the role.
   -> [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md)
   ✓ Each applicable quote is either implemented or recorded as out of scope for the role, with the heading it came from.
3. **Upgrade** (only when asked). Follow the upgrade section from the source line to the target.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ The result cites the target line and no longer depends on a requirement that only the old line stated.

## Verify before done

- [ ] The artifact cites the target line's revision from [Sources](#sources).
- [ ] Every applicable quoted requirement in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md) holds.
- [ ] Nothing from a preview line is emitted unless its posture is build and the user opted in.

- **`references/requirements.md`**: quotes taken from the pinned specification. Load for step 2.
