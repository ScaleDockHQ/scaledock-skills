# Cedar

Cedar is an open-source policy language for authorization, maintained in the `cedar-policy` project. Policies `permit` or `forbid` a principal taking an action on a resource in a context, an authorizer combines them into `Allow` or `Deny`, and a validator checks policies against a schema. With this skill the agent writes Cedar policies, schemas and entity data that validate and that decide requests as intended.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources), with the section it cites. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: policy author, application integrating the authorizer, or reviewer.
- Model: the principals, actions, resources and hierarchies of the application, and which decisions need attributes or context.
- Revision: Cedar language version 4.5, implemented by SDK versions 4.10.0 to 4.13.0; pinned to SDK v4.13.0 (Released, 2026-09-15).
- Sources: when refreshing, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources), check the document history for a new language version and the releases page for a new SDK, and update the pins.

## Invariants

1. **Default deny, forbid overrides permit, skip on error.** Any satisfied `forbid` gives `Deny`; else any satisfied `permit` gives `Allow`; else `Deny`. A policy whose evaluation errors is ignored (authorization, Algorithm and Discussion).
2. **Every policy has an effect and a full scope.** `permit` or `forbid`, then `principal`, `action` and `resource`, each unconstrained or constrained with `==`, `in` or `is`; optional `when` and `unless`; a closing `;` (policy syntax).
3. **A request is PARC**: principal, action and resource are entity references and context is a record (authorization, Request creation).
4. **Entity IDs are unique, immutable and never reused**, such as UUIDs, so that a recycled name never inherits old grants (policy syntax; security best practices).
5. **Validate policies against a schema before use.** The authorizer does not validate; requests and entities must follow the schema, or a valid policy may error at run time and be skipped (validation, Request validation expectations).
6. **Guard optional attributes and tags** with `has` or `.hasTag()` before access; access to a missing attribute is an error (operators, `has`).
7. **Template placeholders are `?principal` and `?resource` only**, on the right of `==` or `in` in the scope (templates).
8. **Build dynamic policies from templates, never string concatenation**, to prevent Cedar code injection (security best practices).
9. **Annotations do not affect evaluation**; `@id` is not special in the language (policy syntax, Annotations).

## Workflow

1. **Model entities and actions.** Choose entity types, parent relations and attributes, and the actions with the principal and resource types they apply to.
   -> [`references/schema-entities.md`](references/schema-entities.md)
   ✓ A Cedar schema declares every entity type and action, with `appliesTo` for each action.
2. **Write the policies.** Start from least privilege, use `in` for groups and hierarchies, and use `forbid` for guardrails.
   -> [`references/policies.md`](references/policies.md)
   ✓ Each policy has a reason in an annotation and uses only schema names.
3. **Use templates where grants are per user or per resource.** Link templates rather than generating policy text.
   -> [`references/policies.md`](references/policies.md)
   ✓ No policy text is built by concatenating input.
4. **Validate.** Run the validator against the schema and fix every error; review warnings.
   -> [`references/validation-evaluation.md`](references/validation-evaluation.md)
   ✓ Validation reports no errors.
5. **Build requests and entity data.** Produce PARC requests and entity JSON that follow the schema, with schema-based parsing where available.
   -> [`references/schema-entities.md`](references/schema-entities.md)
   ✓ Test requests cover allow, deny and forbid-override cases, and the expected determining policies.
6. **Integrate and review.** Authenticate before authorizing, bound input sizes, log decisions with determining policies and errors, and re-validate on schema change.
   -> [`references/validation-evaluation.md`](references/validation-evaluation.md)
   ✓ Errors in the response are monitored, not silently dropped.

## Verify before done

- [ ] Every policy validates against the schema with no errors.
- [ ] Optional attributes and tags are guarded with `has` or `.hasTag()`.
- [ ] Entity IDs are UUIDs or other non-reusable IDs, not names.
- [ ] Tests include a request where a `forbid` overrides a matching `permit`.
- [ ] Policies created at run time are template-linked, not concatenated.
- [ ] Authorization responses' errors are logged.
