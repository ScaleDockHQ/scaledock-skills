# HTTP Semantics and Caching

RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics) and RFC 9111 (HTTP Caching), published by the IETF as Internet Standards, define what HTTP methods, status codes, header fields, conditional requests, content negotiation, range requests and caches mean, independent of the HTTP version. With this skill the agent designs and reviews HTTP APIs and servers that use them correctly, together with the extension fields APIs commonly add: QUERY, Structured Fields, Link, Deprecation, Sunset, api-catalog and Prefer.

**Follow the workflow below step by step.** Every rule here comes from a source in [Sources](#sources), with the section it cites. When a rule and the pinned source disagree, the source wins; when the source has a newer revision than the pin, follow the refresh steps.

## Inputs (fill in, or ask before starting)

- Role: origin server or API, client, intermediary or cache, or author of a new header field.
- Target version, per family (see [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)):
  - Core: RFC 9110 and RFC 9111 (current, default). RFC 7230-7235 is legacy: read it and upgrade from it, never author against it. Idempotency-Key draft-07 is a preview (posture: track): do not add it to new APIs.
  - Query: RFC 10008 QUERY (current).
  - Structured fields: RFC 9651 Structured Fields (current). RFC 8941 Structured Fields is legacy, kept only for fields already defined against it.
  - Lifecycle and discovery: RFC 8288 Web Linking, RFC 9745 Deprecation, RFC 8594 Sunset, RFC 9727 api-catalog and RFC 7240 Prefer (each current, the only line of its family).
- Revision: the pinned revision in [Sources](#sources), unless the user names another.
- Sources: when refreshing this skill or when a rule looks out of date, re-read every URL in [Sources](#sources) first, check each RFC's RFC Editor entry for errata and "obsoleted by" or "updated by", check the datatracker for a new Idempotency-Key revision or RFC, and update the pins.
- Caches in the path: browser only, or shared caches (CDN, reverse proxy) too. This decides `private`, `s-maxage` and Vary.
- Authentication: whether requests carry Authorization. This decides what shared caches may store.
- Resources and operations: the URIs, which operations change state, and which can be retried.

## Invariants

1. **Safe methods stay safe.** GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE and QUERY must not be used to trigger requested state changes; an unsafe action reachable through a safe method MUST be disabled (RFC 9110 § 9.2.1; RFC 10008 § 2).
2. **Only idempotent requests are retried automatically.** A client SHOULD NOT and a proxy MUST NOT automatically retry a non-idempotent request (RFC 9110 § 9.2.2).
3. **Status codes carry their required fields.** 405 MUST carry Allow; 401 MUST carry WWW-Authenticate; 426 MUST carry Upgrade; a PUT that creates MUST answer 201 and one that modifies MUST answer 200 or 204 (RFC 9110 § 15.5.6, § 15.5.2, § 15.5.22, § 9.3.4).
4. **Entity tags are marked and compared correctly.** A tag that is not strong MUST be marked `W/`; If-Match uses strong comparison and If-None-Match weak comparison (RFC 9110 § 8.8.3, § 13.1.1, § 13.1.2).
5. **A false precondition stops the method.** The server MUST NOT perform the method; it answers 412, or 304 for a false If-None-Match or If-Modified-Since on GET and HEAD, evaluated in the § 13.2.2 order, and only after the checks that would give a non-2xx, non-412 response (RFC 9110 § 13.1, § 13.2).
6. **304 and 206 repeat the 200's metadata.** They MUST include the Date, ETag, Vary, Content-Location, Cache-Control and Expires a 200 would have had; a single-part 206 MUST carry Content-Range, and a multipart one MUST NOT carry it at the top level (RFC 9110 § 15.4.5, § 15.3.7).
7. **Caches obey response directives.** `no-store` is never stored; `private` is not stored by shared caches; a shared cache reuses responses to Authorization requests only with `public`, `s-maxage` or `must-revalidate`; caches MUST ignore unknown directives (RFC 9111 § 3, § 3.5, § 5.2.2, § 5.2.3).
8. **Unsafe requests invalidate.** A cache MUST invalidate the target URI after a non-error response to an unsafe method, and MUST NOT invalidate Location or Content-Location URIs of another origin (RFC 9111 § 4.4).
9. **Directive arguments use the defined form.** `max-age`, `s-maxage`, `max-stale` and `min-fresh` MUST NOT be sent quoted (RFC 9111 § 5.2.1, § 5.2.2).
10. **QUERY content is typed and part of the cache key.** A server MUST fail a QUERY with a missing or inconsistent Content-Type; caches MUST include the request content in the cache key (RFC 10008 § 2, § 2.7).
11. **Structured Fields fail closed.** On a parse failure the whole field is ignored, or the message treated as malformed; a field defined against RFC 8941 never carries RFC 9651-only types (RFC 9651 § 4.2, § 2.4).
12. **Link has exactly one rel.** `rel` MUST be present once per link-value, and relative targets resolve against the link context, not a base in the content (RFC 8288 § 3.3, § 3.1).
13. **Deprecation precedes Sunset.** Deprecation is a Structured Date, and the Sunset time MUST NOT be earlier than it (RFC 9745 § 2.1, § 4).
14. **Preferences are optional.** A server MUST ignore preferences it does not support instead of failing, and MUST send `Vary: Prefer` when a preference can change a cacheable response (RFC 7240 § 2).

## Workflow

1. **Pick the version.** Use the current line of each family. If documentation or code cites RFC 7230-7235 or RFC 8941, plan the upgrade (step 10). Treat Idempotency-Key as track.
   -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
   ✓ New documentation cites RFC 9110, RFC 9111 and the current extension RFCs; nothing legacy is authored; Idempotency-Key is only used where it already exists or the user requires it.
2. **Choose methods.** Map each operation to a method by safety and idempotency: GET for reads, QUERY for reads with a request body, PUT for client-addressed replacement, POST for server-addressed creation or processing, DELETE for removal.
   -> [`references/methods-and-status.md`](references/methods-and-status.md)
   ✓ No safe method changes state; no GET or DELETE relies on request content; every method a resource supports is listed in Allow.
3. **Map outcomes to status codes and fields.** Pick the status code for every success and failure, with Location, Content-Location, Allow and Retry-After where they apply. Use the `problem-details` skill for error bodies.
   -> [`references/methods-and-status.md`](references/methods-and-status.md)
   ✓ Each response meets its section's requirements (201 with Location, 405 with Allow, 401 with WWW-Authenticate), and 422 versus 400 versus 415 follows § 15.5.
4. **Add validators and conditional requests.** Send strong ETags and Last-Modified on representations, accept If-None-Match on GET, and require If-Match for updates that must not overwrite each other.
   -> [`references/conditional-and-range.md`](references/conditional-and-range.md)
   ✓ A stale If-Match gets 412 with no change applied; a matching If-None-Match on GET gets 304 with the 200's metadata; `If-None-Match: *` on PUT prevents overwrite.
5. **Add range support** (only for large or resumable representations). Advertise `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, answer 206 and 416 correctly, and honour If-Range.
   -> [`references/conditional-and-range.md`](references/conditional-and-range.md)
   ✓ Single and multipart 206 responses carry the right Content-Range; unsatisfiable ranges get 416 with `bytes */length`.
6. **Negotiate and set Vary.** Decide which request fields select the representation and list them in Vary.
   -> [`references/caching.md`](references/caching.md)
   ✓ Every cacheable negotiated response has Vary; 406 or a default is a deliberate choice; Accept-Charset is not relied on.
7. **Set the caching policy.** Give every response an explicit Cache-Control that matches who may store it and for how long.
   -> [`references/caching.md`](references/caching.md)
   ✓ Per-user responses are `private` or `no-store`; shared-cache lifetimes use `s-maxage`; no API response relies on heuristic freshness by accident.
8. **Define new header fields as Structured Fields.** Name them per RFC 9110 § 16.3.2 and define them as a List, Dictionary or Item per RFC 9651.
   -> [`references/structured-fields.md`](references/structured-fields.md)
   ✓ Each new field names RFC 9651, its top-level type, its constraints and its failure handling, and has no `X-` prefix.
9. **Add lifecycle and discovery fields.** Use Link for relations, Deprecation and Sunset for retirement, api-catalog for discovery, and Prefer for optional behaviour. Use the `ratelimit-headers` skill for quota fields.
   -> [`references/api-lifecycle-fields.md`](references/api-lifecycle-fields.md)
   ✓ Deprecation is a Structured Date, Sunset is an HTTP-date in GMT no earlier than it, `/.well-known/api-catalog` serves `application/linkset+json`, and Prefer-dependent responses carry `Vary: Prefer`.
10. **Upgrade** (only when asked). Follow the upgrade section for each family, from RFC 7230-7235 to RFC 9110 and RFC 9111, and from RFC 8941 to RFC 9651; for POST-based queries, follow the QUERY adoption steps.
    -> [`references/versions.md`](references/versions.md)
    ✓ The upgraded API cites the current RFCs, uses the renamed terms and status phrases, and behaves the same on the wire.

## Verify before done

- [ ] Every method's use matches its safety and idempotency (RFC 9110 § 9.2; RFC 10008 § 2).
- [ ] Every 201 has Location (or the target is the new resource), every 405 has Allow, every 401 has WWW-Authenticate (RFC 9110 § 15.3.2, § 15.5.6, § 15.5.2).
- [ ] ETags are quoted, weak ones carry `W/`, and successful PUT responses only carry validators for content stored unchanged (RFC 9110 § 8.8.3, § 9.3.4).
- [ ] Preconditions are evaluated in the § 13.2.2 order and answer 412 or 304 as § 13.1 requires.
- [ ] Every 304 and 206 repeats the 200's Date, ETag, Vary, Content-Location, Cache-Control and Expires (RFC 9110 § 15.4.5, § 15.3.7).
- [ ] Every response a shared cache could see has explicit Cache-Control, and responses to authenticated requests are not shared unless intended (RFC 9111 § 3.5, § 5.2.2).
- [ ] Directive arguments for `max-age` and `s-maxage` are unquoted; `no-cache` and `private` field lists are quoted (RFC 9111 § 5.2.2).
- [ ] New fields are Structured Fields with a documented type, and none is prefixed `X-` (RFC 9651 § 2; RFC 9110 § 16.3.2.1).
- [ ] Sunset is not earlier than Deprecation, and both are hints that do not change behaviour (RFC 9745 § 4, § 5).
- [ ] Nothing from the Idempotency-Key preview is added to a new API unless the user asked for it, and any use is labelled as an expired draft.
